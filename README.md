# Fractal Overload

[Fractals](https://fractalfoundation.org/resources/what-are-fractals/) are a fascinating thing that is normally
found in nature. It is a complex pattern where it makes a repetitive design. Look for a snowflake for example,
that can be considered a fractal.

With a specific bit of knowledge in programming and geometry such as recursion and linear transformation, you can also
produce interesting fractal patterns that might make you wonder how much can your computer handle the processing of the
recursion as the repetitive pattern goes smaller and smaller.


### Usage

using pipenv

```bash
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv run fractal
```

using bare python

```bash
$ pip install numpy
$ pip install opencv-python
$ python main.py
```
